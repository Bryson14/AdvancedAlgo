# Poly Multiplication w/ Fast Fourier Transform
## To Run:
python poly_multiply.py --> runs the analysis

TODO add some other stuff here

## Intro
This algorithm builds on past aassignments and tests the speed of three algorithms when multiplying very large integers.
The three algorithms are:

* High School Algorithm (FOIL)
* Three-subproblem Algorithm
* FFT

## Results
TBD
