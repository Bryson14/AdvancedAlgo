# This is a emperical study between the classic FOIL method that was taught in high school versus the efficiency of a algorithm better suited to computation speed.
======

** To run**
'python main.py'

There will appear options to run:
..*a large study comparing FOIL and the other method
..*Manually enter two polynomials to multiply and run with FOIL
..*Manually enter two polynomials to multiply and run with the other algorithm
