# Fast Fourier Transform

## Intro
I had a lot of trial and error in this algorithm. I know this is a valuable algorithm that is used in many different applications. However, it took an eternity and a half to wrap my head aorund what it was actually doing. So in additioin to my professor's notes and videos, here are some of the resources I used to better understand the good work of Mr. Cooley and Mr. Tukey
