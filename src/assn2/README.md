Welcome to my homework. 

Run driver.py from the directory assn2 to enter into the program.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice dynamic programming and memoizing techniques to speed up recursive programs

There are two different problems to be solved:
The first is a knapsack program that involves a set of items and one knapsack. The goal of the algorithm is to return True if the knapsack can be filled exactly, or False if it cannot be filled exactly.

The second is a problem that involves two knapsacks and a set of items with different point values. The goal of hte algorithm is the maximize the total point value that can be carried in the two knapsack while following the size limits of the two knapsacks.
