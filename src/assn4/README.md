To manually enter in a DNA sequence, enter the command 'MED' when prompted.

Note, this program scores DNA sequences based on a given table:

 Point system when substituting one nucleotide for another nucleotide. 
d represents a deletion from the sequence

	    A  C  G  T  d
	A   5 -1 -2 -1 -3
	C  -1  5 -3 -2 -4
	G  -2 -3  5 -2 -2
	T  -1 -2 -2  5 -1
	d  -3 -4 -2 -1  *

If a sequence entered contains characters other than ACGT, then the program will fail.
